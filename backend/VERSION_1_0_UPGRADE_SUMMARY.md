# PGPFinLit B Version 1.0 - Major Architectural Upgrade Summary

## Overview
The PGPFinLit Bot has been transformed from a reactive assistant into a proactive, personalized financial planning tool with structured data management and interactive tools.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Structured Financial Profile
- **New Data Model**: Each conversation now maintains a comprehensive `financial_profile` object containing:
  - Income (total and sources breakdown)
  - Expenses (recurring and one-time categories)
  - Debts (with balance, rate, and payment details)
  - Goals (with target and current progress)
  - Last updated timestamp

### 2. Intelligent Context Engine
- **Function**: `update_profile_and_get_summary()`
- Automatically parses user messages to extract financial data
- Updates the structured profile in real-time
- Generates human-readable summaries for AI context

### 3. Interactive Financial Tools

#### Excel Budget Generator
- **Tool Call**: `[TOOL_CALL:GENERATE_BUDGET_SHEET]`
- Creates multi-sheet Excel workbooks with:
  - Budget summary
  - Income breakdown
  - Expense categories
  - Debt tracking
  - Goal progress

#### Financial Health Score
- **Tool Call**: `[TOOL_CALL:CALCULATE_HEALTH_SCORE]`
- Comprehensive scoring system (0-100)
- Letter grades (A-F)
- Breakdown by category:
  - Budget management (40 points)
  - Debt ratio (30 points)
  - Emergency fund (20 points)
  - Savings progress (10 points)

#### Debt Payoff Simulator
- **Tool Call**: `[TOOL_CALL:DEBT_SIMULATOR:{amount}]`
- Calculates accelerated payoff with extra payments
- Shows months saved and interest reduced

#### Savings Goal Calculator
- **Tool Call**: `[TOOL_CALL:SAVINGS_CALCULATOR:{goal}:{amount}:{months}]`

### 4. Proactive AI Behavior
- **New System Prompt**: Complete overhaul focusing on:
  - Proactive information gathering
  - Automatic tool suggestions
  - Structured conversation flow (Gather → Analyze → Act)
  - Clear security boundaries

### 5. Tool Dispatcher System
- Integrated into the `/chat` endpoint
- Automatically detects tool calls in AI responses

- Appends results to the response stream
- Removes tool syntax from user-visible text

### 6. New API Endpoints
- `GET /download/{filename}`: Secure file download for Excel exports
- Enhanced `GET /conversation/{conversation_id}`: Returns full financial profile

## Security Enhancements
- Tool call syntax is hidden from users
- Strict validation prevents directory traversal in downloads
- Financial data is isolated per conversation

## Technical Implementation
- Uses pandas for Excel generation
- In-memory storage with structured data models
- Regex-based parsing for financial data extraction
- Streaming response with post-processing for tools

## Usage Flow
1. User provides financial information through natural conversation
2. System automatically extracts and structures the data
3. AI proactively suggests relevant tools based on context
4. Tools execute and provide actionable insights
5. Results are seamlessly integrated into the conversation
